This is still a huge work in progress, currently the only functionality
implemented is the simulator, and requires an assembled, linked object module
built by the existing RIT CS department `rasm` and `rlink` tools.

My current plan is to work backwards in functionality, ensuring that I have
(mostly) complete parity with the existing tools, even though I can't actually
look at their source, or even their binaries, just their outputs.
